# Design Tokens for UvA

This project uses [Style Dictionary v3+](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) to define our common design language with Design Tokens.
It also uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to visualize these Design Tokens

## Getting started

To install all packages and start the developer environment:

```shell
yarn
yarn bootstrap
yarn storybook
```

This will start storybook and a watcher for the design-token package. If you change a value in the design-token package your storybook should update automatically.
